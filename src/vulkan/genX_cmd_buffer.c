    *
    *    Coherency with system memory in the state cache, like the texture
    *    cache is handled partially by software. It is expected that the
    *    command stream or shader will issue Cache Flush operation or
    *    Cache_Flush sampler message to ensure that the L1 cache remains
    *    coherent with system memory.
    *
    *    [...]
    *
    *    Whenever the value of the Dynamic_State_Base_Addr,
    *    Surface_State_Base_Addr are altered, the L1 state cache must be
    *    invalidated to ensure the new surface or sampler state is fetched
    *    from system memory.
    *
    * The PIPE_CONTROL command has a "State Cache Invalidation Enable" bit
    * which, according the PIPE_CONTROL instruction documentation in the
    * Broadwell PRM:
    *
    *    Setting this bit is independent of any other bit in this packet.
    *    This bit controls the invalidation of the L1 and L2 state caches
    *    at the top of the pipe i.e. at the parsing time.
    *
    * Unfortunately, experimentation seems to indicate that state cache
    * invalidation through a PIPE_CONTROL does nothing whatsoever in
    * regards to surface state and binding tables.  In stead, it seems that
    * invalidating the texture cache is what is actually needed.
    *
    * XXX:  As far as we have been able to determine through
    * experimentation, shows that flush the texture cache appears to be
    * sufficient.  The theory here is that all of the sampling/rendering
    * units cache the binding table in the texture cache.  However, we have
    * yet to be able to actually confirm this.
