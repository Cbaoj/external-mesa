Intel Vulkan ToDo
=================

Missing Features:
 - FP64
 - Tessellation
 - Cull and Clip Distance
 - Sampler anisotropy (Is there anything to do here?)
 - Image Gather Extended
 - Storage Image Without Format
 - Investigate CTS failures on HSW

Code sharing with GL:
 - Add surface capability introspection to ISL (pull the surface format
   table from brw_surface_formats.c)
 - Generalize blorp to use ISL and be sharable between the two drivers

Performance:
 - HiZ (Nanley)
 - Fast color clears (after HiZ?)
 - Compressed multisample support
 - Renderbuffer compression (SKL+)
 - Pushing pieces of UBOs?
