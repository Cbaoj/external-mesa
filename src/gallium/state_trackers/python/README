This directory contains Python bindings to Gallium3D. It looks like a state
tracker from the pipe driver perspective, and it looks like a pipe driver from
the python script perspective.


To build you'll need:
* Python (with development packages)
* SCons
* SWIG
* Python Imaging Library (for the samples)

Invoke scons on the top dir as
 
 scons statetrackers=python

To use do

 export PYTHONPATH=build/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX/gallium/state_trackers/python

and then try running

  python src/gallium/state_trackers/python/samples/simple.py

which should create a simple.png


This is still in experimental phase, and there many limitations to what you can
do with from Python.
