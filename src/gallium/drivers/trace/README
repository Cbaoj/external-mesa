This directory contains a Gallium3D pipe driver which traces all incoming calls.

To build, invoke scons on the top dir as
 
 scons statetrackers=mesa drivers=softpipe,i915simple,trace winsys=xlib

To use do

 ln -s libGL.so build/linux-x86-debug/gallium/winsys/xlib/libGL.so.1
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/build/linux-x86-debug/gallium/winsys/xlib
 export GALLIUM_TRACE=y

ensure the right libGL.so is being picked by doing

 ldd `which glxinfo` 

and then try running

 glxinfo

which should create a gallium.*.trace file, which is an XML file. You can view 
copying trace.xsl and trace.css to the same directory, and opening with a 
XSLT capable browser like Firefox or Internet Explorer.
