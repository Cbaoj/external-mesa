This directory contains a Gallium3D pipe driver which traces all incoming calls.

To build, invoke scons on the top dir as
 
 scons statetrackers=mesa drivers=softpipe,i915simple,trace winsys=xlib

To use do

 ln -s libGL.so build/linux-x86-debug/gallium/winsys/xlib/libGL.so.1
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/build/linux-x86-debug/gallium/winsys/xlib

ensure the right libGL.so is being picked by doing

 ldd `which glxinfo` 

and then try running

 GALLIUM_TRACE=tri.trace ./progs/trivial/tri

which should create a tri.trace file, which is an XML file. You can view copying 
trace.xsl to the same directory, and opening with a XSLT capable browser like 
Firefox or Internet Explorer.
